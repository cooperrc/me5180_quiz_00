1. A golfball of mass, $m=46~g$, is struck by a golf club. It initially starts at rest,
   then flies through the air with an initial speed of $v_0$. Which
   equation would give you the impulse applied to the golf ball?
   a. $impulse = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$
   b. $impulse = m\frac{v_0}{\Delta t}$
   c. $impulse = mv_0$
   d. $impulse = 0$
   
2. A roller coaster, $m=100~kg$ is designed with a 20-meter drop. You are the
   engineer that must choose a braking system to bring it to a stop as
   it reaches the horizontal landing. Which equation
   would give you the work needed to stop the roller coaster?
   a. $work = -mgh$
   b. $work = -mg{\Delta t}$
   c. $work = -ma$
   d. $work = 0$

3. Galileo correctly theorized that any object will roll down the
   inclined plane with a constant acceleration. 

Do all round objects roll at the same rate? Consider a long ramp with a
total height change of 1 meter and horizontal distance of 10 meters. 

a. What speed will a R=0.1-m sphere leave the ramp, $I=\frac{2}{5}mR^2$?
c. What speed will a R=0.1-m disk leave the ramp, $I=\frac{1}{2}mR^2$?
